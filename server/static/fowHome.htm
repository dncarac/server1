<p>
Welcome to my &quot;Fond of Writing&quot; page !</p>
<p>
We live in great times. The advance of the internet technology
and its entry into our everyday life have changed the communication
habits of quite a few of us: instead of being restricted to communicate
with those living nearby, or to write letters to friends living
at a greater distance, we nowadays are able to get to know people
from all over the world. And we exchange ideas with them on
media supporting almost instantaneous communication: emails, mailing
lists, newsgroups and chat systems, to name just a few. </p>
<p>
This leads to long-distance relationships of all forms. These
pages are tailored to a very specific form of relationship: the
mistress-slave relationship between consenting adults. Being
long-distance poses a very specific problem for this kind of interaction:
whereas in a real-life relation the mistress can very easily (and
effectively) make sure that her commands are obeyed, this is not
so easily possible if contact exists only via email.</p>
<p>
To come to help I have developed a little tool, to be used in
situations where the mistress wants to discipline her slave -
this tool allows a mistress to define a typing task for her slave.
The tool controls the typing, and generates a report which can be
send via email as a proof that the task has been completed as
ordered.</p>
<p>
I got the basic idea for this tool from the <font color="#ff0000"><u>Good Times</u></font> <font color="#00ffff">[the original link is no longer in service]</font> page. The &quot;Keep him busy&quot; tool found there is based on the
common features of HTML (web-)browsers, and therefore independent
of any specific computer platform. At the same time it is limited
in its possibilities by this approach - I wanted to add more features,
and was willing to accept that my tool only runs on Personal Computers
under the Windows 32-bit operating systems.</p>
<p>
You can use the menu on the left hand side to find out more about
my tool, and to download it if you are interested. If you want to
try out the tool afterwards, as a mistress or as a slave, I recommend
that you join the femdom roleplay mailing list hosted by <font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#ff0000"><u>Topica</u></font></font>&nbsp; <font color="#00ffff">[original link no longer in service]</font>.</p>
<p>If you have any comments on</p>
<ul>
<li>my mistreatment of the English language (please be lenient, this
isn't my first language)</li>
<li>any bugs or ways to cheat which you found</li>
<li>which possible improvements you would like</li>
<li>how you like my tool</li></ul></font>
