<h2>
Intended mode of operation</h2>
<p>
The first step is for the mistress to define the task: a task consists
of a text, which has to be typed in repeatedly, and the number of
repetitions or the time during which the slave has to type in the
text. A couple of additional options can be chosen, which make life
more difficult for the slave (see below under <a href="#options">options</a>).</p>
<p>
The tool consists of a number of dialogs. In the initial dialog shown above the
slave enters the text to be typed, and any options chosen by his
mistress. Alternative the mistress can pack a task into a task file
with the help of the FOW TaskEditor - the slave then simply loads this
task definition file by pressing the &quot;Load Task&quot; button and selecting
the task file. The description of the TaskEditor is a <a href="fowEditor.htm">separate document</a>.</p>
<p>
The slave then presses the start button. A text entry dialog will
appear; the slave must set the focus to the text entry field with the
help of the mouse, type in the text, submit the text to the tool again
by pressing &quot;Submit&quot; with the mouse, set the input focus back to the text
entry field, type in text, and so on.</p>
<p>
When the requested number of repetitions of the text have been entered,
or when the specified time span has elapsed, the text entry dialog will
close and the slave can generate a report. The text entry box can be
closed prematurely by pressing &quot;Cancel&quot; - the report will give still the
information about the number of repetitions achieved and the time spend
while typing in the text.</p>
<p>
If mistress and slave are at the same location, everything ends here:
the report can't be edited in the report generator dialog, and the
mistress can inspect the result of the slaves work in this dialog.</p>
<p>
If mistress and slave are living apart from another, the report has
to be emailed by the slave. With the help of the button it can be copied
to the clipboard, and from there it can be copied into an email (usually
Ctrl-V or Menu Edit/Paste within the mail program) which is send to the
mistress.</p>
<p>
Once copied into the mail, the report can be freely edited. In order
to avoid any tampering with contents of the report by the slave, the
report contains a digital signature. If any part of the report is
modified, report and signature will not match. </p>
<p>
The tool allows to verify the integrity of a report and its signature
with the help of the verify dialog. The mistress marks the report
received within a mail, copies this part to the clipboard (usually
Ctrl-C or menu Edit/Copy), opens the verification dialog and pastes
the report with the help of the paste button into the verification form.
The tool will then recompute the signature of the report and decide
whether this is identical to the one contained in the report.</p>
<p><u>Note 1)</u> Because some email programs reformat long lines, only printable
characters are relevant for the signature... additional (or missing)
line splits, blanks, tab chars etc. do not invalidate a report.</p>
<p><u>Note 2)</u> The report starts with the line &lt;Start of report&gt; and ends with
the line &lt;End of report&gt;. At least these two lines and all lines in between
must be copied into the verification dialog; it is admissible to copy more,
the whole email for instance, and to give it to the verification dialog.</p>
<p><u>Note 3)</u> The signature also verifies the integrity of the program itself.
If a report/signature mismatch is detected, this can be a consequence
of different versions of the program used by the slave and his mistress.
The second line of the report contains the version number of the tool
which generated the report; the version number of the tool which checks
the signature is displayed in the title bar of the tool itself. A signature
cannot be recognized if these version numbers are not identical.</p>

<p>
The text to be typed in has to be entered in the first line. If no text
has been entered, pressing the Start button will only lead to a message
beep.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">run for a fixed number of repetitions :</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">nnn times</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">run for a fixed time span :</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">mmm minutes</font></td></tr>  </tbody></table>
<p>
These are in fact convenience options for the slave: when the given limit
is reached, the tool informs the slave that he now can generate the report
(isn't this a nice tool ?! ;-). The numbers do not have to be set, the slave
can decide without the help of the tool how long to type, and press Cancel
in the text entry dialog once he wants to generate a report. If both numbers
are given, both conditions have to be fulfilled in order that the tool will
stop.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">[ ] hide text by replacing typed chars with *</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
Any characters entered by the slave will be displayed as an asterisk. This
makes the task to enter a correct line more difficult. This option only
works for a single-line text, multi-line texts will always be readable.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">[ ] the text has to be entered backwards</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
If this checkbox is marked, the text (e.g) &quot;i am your obedient slave&quot; would
have to be entered as &quot;evals tneidebo ruoy ma i&quot;.</p>
<p>
Distracting Dialogs:<br />
The tool can randomly pop up a little dialog box, which has to be closed
before typing can go on. This box has a <u>very</u> small button, which has to
be hit with the mouse in order that the dialog box closes. The frequency
with which this box is displayed depends on the chosen setting:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">occasionally:</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">on the average every 45 seconds</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">(randomly between 36 and 54 secs)</font>    </td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">often:</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">on the average every 15 seconds</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">(randomly between 12 and 18 secs)</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
    &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">very often:</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">on the average every 5 seconds</font></td>
<td align="left"><font face="Arial">(randomly between 4 and 6 secs)</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
A little word of warning: certain combinations of the above options (a long
text, hidden text, reverse text and frequent distraction dialogs) make it <u>very</u>
hard to enter the text correctly even once. Responsible mistresses therefore
often try the task themselves before giving them to their slaves... for a minute,
for example, or for three repetitions...</p>
<h2>
Reports</h2>
<p>
A report has the following form:</p>
<pre><font "="" face="Courier New">&lt;Start of report&gt;
FondOfWriting Version 1.0

Text :
i am your obedient slave
---End of text---
Hide text : no
Reverse Text : no
Distractions : often

Start time: 1999/11/24  21:29:24
Duration : 1 minute(s) 5 second(s)
Typed lines : 6
Faulty lines : 1
Longest breaks between two lines :
15 second(s)
13 second(s)
12 second(s)

&lt;Signature&gt;
BA36179B3A053E768D03870E13E07FAD
&lt;End of report&gt;</font></pre>
<p>
Most of the information contained within should be self explanatory. The tool
measures the time it takes the slave to enter a line, and displays the three
longest times it encountered - this will help to decide whether the slave took
an unallowed break while performing the task.</p></a></font><a id="options" name="options"></a>
