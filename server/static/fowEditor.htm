<font face="Script" size="7"><strong>Fond Of Writing  -  The TaskEditor</strong></font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p>
The TaskEditor allows a mistress to save parameters and options
for a task in a task file. This task file can then be send to
the slave, which loads it with the tool and can start to perform
the required task. Using a task file (default extension: *.tsk)
presents two advantages compared to the method of just telling
the slave what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are a couple of additional configuration parameters,
which can't be changed from within the tool itself</li>
<li>If the mistress wishes so, the slave will have to perform
the task without being told beforehand the number of required
repetitions or the requested time span - he will have to go on
typing until the tool tells him that he has completed the task.</li></ul>
<p>
The TaskEditor organizes the different options on four separate
pages, which can be activated with the help of the tab labels.
The first page resembles the configuration dialog of the FOW tool :</p>

<p>
If you have understood the functionality of the <a href="fowTool.htm">
FondOfWriting tool</a>, most of the entry fields above should be obvious
in their meaning.</p>
<p><br />
The following additional configuration options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>the text in the titlebar of the initial dialog of the tool
can be changed<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>for each faulty line entered by the slave the number of repetitions
or the time span of the task can be automatically increased<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>the picture displayed in the main dialog of the tool can be replaced.<br />
Pictures to be used must exist in the Windows Bitmap
format (*.bmp). The tool will scale any picture submitted to its
display area of 144x210 pixels - but since Bitmap pictures are
uncompressed, it is advisable to transform them beforehand to this
format and a colordepth of 8 bits (256 colors), especially if you want
to send the task file via email to someone<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>task files can be password protected. If a password is set when
you save a task file, this file can only be opened by the Editor
once the identical password has been entered.</li></ul>
<p><br />
A little word of <font color="FF8080">warning</font> on behalf of two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If neither a repetition count nor a time span is specified, the tool
will run indefinitely. If you try to save such a task, the editor will ask
back if that is really your intention.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
If the reverse text option is activated, and the informational text
in the Text Entry dialog is set by the task, there is no
automatic notification for the slave that the task demands him to
type the text backwards. Please add a corresponding remark to the
informational text in this case.</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;<br />
The second page allows to specify up to 7 additional texts to be typed :</p>
<center><img alt="" src="TaskEditor2.gif" /></center>
<p>
These texts are either presented in order to the slave, or randomly, if
the box below the text entry field is checked.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;<br />
The third page allows to configure the texts used in the text entry box :</p>
<center><img alt="" src="TaskEditor3.gif" /></center>
<p>
Up to four command lines can be specified, which are used in the
order given, or in a random order by the tool.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;<br />
The fourth page allows to configure the texts used in the distraction
popup dialog :</p>
<center><img alt="" src="TaskEditor4.gif" /></center>
<p>
Up to four text lines can be specified, which are used in the
order given, or in a random order by the tool. <br />
Additionally the
tool can randomly position the button, which has to be pressed
in order to close the dialog.</p></font>
