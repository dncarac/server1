<p>
The FondOfWriting tool and the corresponding TaskEditor are freeware,
and may be freely distributed. I am putting them at your disposition
&quot;as is&quot; - I will not be hold responsible if they don't work as you
expect them to work, and/or or if you find any bugs.</p>
<p>
The only guarantee I can give is that I have coded them without any
malicious intent... well, when I think about that, there was a little
bit of malicious intent with regard to the slaves free time, but I
suppose that this can't be hold against me *g*.</p>
<p>
These tools require Windows95, Windows98, WinNT or Windows2000 to run.
They work without any setup - just copy them to a directory of your choice.</p>
